# ptx-2d
This is a matlab toolbox for designing parallel transmit (pTx) 2D RF pulses.
You may run the demo script, `pTx2D.m`, to grab an idea of how this toolbox can be used to design 2D pTx pulses to excite a "M" logo of the University of Minnesota in a spherical phantom. 

If you use the toolbox, please consider citing the following paper:
